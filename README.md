# Arcane-Codex
A codex for a supernatural investigation TTRPG utilizing the Basic Roleplaying system (BRP).

## Running with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run Arcane Codex is with Docker Compose. The database is persisted automatically in a named Docker volume.

```bash
# Copy the example env file and (optionally) edit HOST_PORT
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start the app
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever `HOST_PORT` is set to).

### Changing the host port

Set `HOST_PORT` before starting Compose, or add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
# One-off override
HOST_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d

# Or in .env
echo "HOST_PORT=8080" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```
